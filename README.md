steessenger Steem Messenger

## This is an unfinished project !

Steessenger works with the Steem Blockchain (https://github.com/steemit/steem)

**Steessenger is meant as a single flat .html file, lightweight, pure JS, wallet client for Steem.**

It should run locally in any browser newer than IE 5 ...

It filters a users' account history for transfers and displays the result in the style of a messenger app.
